# JS Workshop on A11y (accessibility)

A [Toronto JavaScript](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/) meetup: [JS workshop on a11y (accessibility)](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/mflctqyzpbqb/?gj=co2&rv=co2&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDk5YWU1ZGQwLTA0ZTAtNDVjNy1hNTJkLTk4ODZmMGNiY2U4ZA), led by Sherry Yang from Juno College (formerly HackerYou). These are my notes from the a11y workshop.

## Intro

<https://a11yproject.com/>

Disability reflects interaction of features of person and features of society that person's in. So much more broader than physical, can also be situational (and temporary) impairments. (Aside: more examples [here](https://github.com/hchiam/web-accessibility-course-notes#web-accessibility-a11y-course-notes).)

Good a11y can help everyone, it doesn't just help those with disabilities: curb-side effect (not just for wheelchair users; also helps people with carriages/carts, or letting small babies be able to step up).
